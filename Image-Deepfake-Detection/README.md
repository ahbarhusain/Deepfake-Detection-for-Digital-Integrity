# Deepfake Detection using MesoNet with PyTorch

## Dataset

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjilkarki/deepfake-and-real-images

This dataset contains manipulated images and real images. The manipulated images are the faces which are created by various means. The source for this dataset was https://zenodo.org/record/5528418#.YpdlS2hBzDd
this dataset was processed as our will to get maximum outcome out of these images. Each image is a 256 X 256 jpg image of human face either real or fake

## Overview

This project implements deepfake detection using MesoNet, a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed specifically for detecting deepfake images. The model is trained on a dataset containing both real and deepfake images and is deployed for real-world deepfake image detection.

## Features
- Utilizes MesoNet architecture for deepfake image detection.
- Preprocessing techniques for image dataset preparation.
- Training and evaluation procedures for model development.
- Deployment for real-world deepfake image detection.
- Flask application for interactive deepfake image detection via a web interface.
