# Deepfake Detection Project

This repository contains implementations for audio, image, text, and video deepfake detection.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.7 or higher is recommended). You can create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Usage
Audio Deepfake Detection
To run the audio deepfake detection model, navigate to the audio directory and execute the main script:

```bash
cd audio-deepfake-detection-main
python main.py
Image Deepfake Detection
To run the image deepfake detection model, navigate to the image directory and execute the server script:

```bash
cd Image-Deepfake-Detection
python server.py

Text Deepfake Detection
For the text deepfake detection, download the fine-tuned RoBERTa model from the following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16Be7V62ew3PVf5pbxNOr_uLB1CTGpYg-/view?usp=sharing
Place the downloaded model in the text deepfake detection directory, then run:

```bash
cd Text-Deepfake-Detection
python index.py

Video Deepfake Detection
To run the video deepfake detection model, navigate to the video directory and execute the model script:

```bash
cd VideoDeepFakeDetection-main
python model.py
